Get answers to common questions about CloudThinker, our AI agents, and how Agentic AI transforms cloud operations.

---

## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is CloudThinker and how does it work?">
    CloudThinker is a Multi-Agents (MAS) Orchestration platform that uses specialized AI agents to automate cloud operations. Our five expert agents - Alex (Cloud Engineer), Oliver (Security Professional), Tony (Database Administrator), Kai (Kubernetes Administrator), and Anna (Technology Leader) - work together to optimize, secure, and manage your cloud infrastructure autonomously.

    You interact with agents using natural language commands like `@alex analyze EC2 instances with low utilization` or `@oliver perform security audit`, and they execute hundreds of pre-defined operations or custom tasks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is CloudThinker different from traditional cloud management tools?">
    **Traditional Tools:**
    - Manual configuration and monitoring
    - Reactive alerts and dashboards  
    - Human-dependent analysis and decision-making
    - Siloed tools for different functions

    **CloudThinker:**
    - Autonomous AI agents that understand context
    - Proactive optimization and issue prevention
    - Intelligent analysis with actionable recommendations
    - Unified multi-agent collaboration across all cloud operations
  </Accordion>

## AI Agents & Operations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do the AI agents actually work? Are they really autonomous?">
    Our AI agents are powered by advanced language models trained on cloud operations expertise. Each agent has:
    
    **Specialized Knowledge:** Deep expertise in their domain (cloud engineering, security, databases, etc.)
    
    **Contextual Understanding:** Ability to understand your infrastructure, requirements, and business context
    
    **Tool Integration:** Access to hundreds of pre-built operations and cloud APIs
    
    **Learning Capabilities:** Continuous improvement based on your environment and feedback
    
    **Safety Controls:** Built-in safeguards and approval workflows for sensitive operations

    They operate autonomously within defined parameters but can escalate complex decisions to human operators when needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I trust AI agents to make changes to my production environment?">
    CloudThinker implements multiple safety layers:

    **Graduated Autonomy:** Start with read-only analysis, gradually increase automation as trust builds
    
    **Approval Workflows:** Configure required approvals for sensitive operations
    
    **Change Windows:** Restrict automated changes to maintenance windows
    
    **Rollback Capabilities:** Automatic rollback for operations that don't meet success criteria
    
    **Audit Trail:** Complete logging of all agent actions and decisions
    
    **Risk Assessment:** Agents evaluate risk before suggesting or implementing changes

    Most customers start with "recommend-only" mode and progressively enable automation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I communicate with the AI agents? Do I need to learn special commands?">
    CloudThinker agents understand natural language, making communication intuitive:

    **Agent Syntax:** Use @agent-name to direct requests to specific agents

    **Tool Syntax:** Use #tool-name to specify desired outputs

    **Natural Language:** Agents understand context, follow-up questions, and conversational requests

    Examples:
    - "Show me last month's cost trends"
    - "What security issues need immediate attention?"
    - "Can you optimize our database performance?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can multiple agents work together on complex problems?">
    Yes! Multi-agent collaboration is one of CloudThinker's key strengths:

    **Coordinated Analysis:** Multiple agents can investigate issues together
    
    **Knowledge Sharing:** Agents share context and findings automatically
    
    **Specialized Expertise:** Each agent contributes their domain expertise to complex problems
    
    **Unified Reporting:** Collaborative findings presented in coherent recommendations

    **Example Scenarios:**
    - **Incident Response:** All agents coordinate to analyze different aspects of an outage
    - **Security Review:** Oliver leads with Alex providing infrastructure context
    - **Performance Optimization:** Tony (database) + Kai (Kubernetes) + Alex (infrastructure) collaboration
  </Accordion>

    **ROI Guarantee:** Most customers save 3-5x their CloudThinker subscription cost through cloud optimizations alone.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do seats work?">
    A **seat** is a paid slot on your subscription. Each seat you purchase is fully charged and immediately grants its full credit allocation — whether or not a team member is using it yet.

    **Only active members use seats.** Pending invitations do not count toward your seat usage. A seat is only consumed when someone actually joins your organization.

    **Pre-purchase seats for more credits.** You can buy more seats than your current team size. Every purchased seat grants its full credits right away, so this is a simple way to increase your organization's credit pool.

    **Adding seats mid-cycle.** If a new member joins and your active members exceed your purchased seats, the system automatically adds a seat. You're charged the full seat price and receive the full credits immediately.

    **Removing members.** When a member leaves, your seat usage goes down. Since you've already paid for the current billing cycle, your credits stay intact until the cycle ends. The seat count adjusts on your next renewal.

    **Minimum seats:**
    - **Pro** and **Team** — No minimum, start with 1 seat
    - **Business** — Minimum 5 seats
    - **Enterprise** — Minimum 25 seats
