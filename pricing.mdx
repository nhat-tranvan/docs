## How Credits Work

Credits are the currency for AI agent operations. Each interaction with an agent consumes credits based on complexity.

When you use credits, they are consumed in this order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Daily Credits">
    5 free credits that reset every 24 hours. Available on all plans.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rollover Credits">
    Unused monthly credits carried forward from previous cycles (Team and
    above). Oldest credits are used first.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bonus Credits">
    Promotional credits from referrals or special offers. Never expire.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add-on Credits">
    One-time credit packs you can purchase from your subscription settings (Team
    and above). Credits persist until used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monthly Credits">
    Your plan's per-seat credit allocation, reset each billing cycle.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pay-As-You-Go">
    Automatic top-up when all other credits are exhausted. Charged at
    $0.10/credit. Only if PAYG is enabled.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)

Never run out of credits during critical operations. PAYG automatically kicks in when your other credits are exhausted.

|                          | Details                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Rate**                 | $0.10 per credit                                                               |
| **Availability**         | Team, Business, and Enterprise plans                                           |
| **Monthly spending cap** | Set your own limit (default $100/month, minimum $1) or remove the cap entirely |
| **Billing**              | Metered — you only pay for what you use at the end of each billing cycle       |
| **Control**              | Enable or disable anytime from your subscription settings                      |

<Warning>
  PAYG is not available on the Starter or Pro plans, and is locked during trial
  periods. Upgrade to Team or above to enable it.
</Warning>

## How Seats Work

A **seat** is a paid slot on your subscription. Each seat grants its full credit allocation immediately upon purchase.

- **Only active members use seats.** Pending invitations don't count toward your seat usage.
- **Pre-purchase seats for more credits.** Buy extra seats to boost your organization's credit pool, even before team members join.
- **Mid-cycle additions.** When a new member exceeds your seat count, a seat is added automatically with prorated billing.
- **Member departures.** Credits stay intact for the current cycle. Seat count adjusts at next renewal.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I change my plan?">
    Absolutely! You can **upgrade** anytime — the new plan kicks in immediately and you only pay the prorated difference for the rest of your billing cycle.

    Need to adjust to a different plan? Our support team is happy to help find the best option for you. Just reach out at support@cloudthinker.io.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens when I run out of credits?">
  Your daily credits (5/day) refresh every 24 hours, so you always have basic
  access. If your monthly credits run out, you can enable Pay-As-You-Go
  ($0.10/credit) on Team plans and above, purchase add-on credit packs, add more
  seats to increase your pool, or wait for the next billing cycle reset.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I switch to annual billing?">
  Yes! Switch from monthly to annual anytime and start saving ~20% right away — the change takes effect immediately with fair prorated billing.

  If you're on an annual plan and want to make changes, our support team can help. Just email support@cloudthinker.io.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need a credit card for the free trial?">
  Yes — we ask for a card so your service continues uninterrupted if you decide
  to stay after the trial. You will not be charged during the 14-day trial
  period, and you can cancel anytime with one click.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What ROI can I expect?">
    Most customers save **3-5x** their subscription cost through cloud optimizations. Typical results include 30-50% cloud cost reduction and 75% less time on manual operations. See our [FAQ](/learn/faq#what-kind-of-roi-can-i-expect-from-cloudthinker) for detailed ROI data.
