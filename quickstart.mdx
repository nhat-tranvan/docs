### Connection Setup

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS Setup">
    CloudThinker supports two methods for AWS authentication:

    ### Method 1: Access Keys (IAM User)

    **Required Credentials:**
    1. **Access Key ID**: Your AWS access key (starts with AKIA...)
    2. **Secret Access Key**: Your AWS secret access key

    **Security Best Practices:**
    - Use IAM users with minimal required permissions
    - Prefer read-only access keys when possible
    - Enable MFA for your AWS account

    ### Method 2: Role-Based Access (Recommended)

    **Required Information:**
    1. **IAM Role ARN**: The ARN of the IAM role to assume (e.g., `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CloudThinkerRole`)
    2. **External ID** (optional): Additional security token for role assumption

    **Setup Instructions:**
    1. Create an IAM role in your AWS account
    2. Configure the trust policy to allow CloudThinker to assume the role
    3. Attach policies with minimal required permissions
    4. Copy the Role ARN to CloudThinker

    **Benefits:**
    - No long-lived credentials to manage
    - Temporary security credentials with automatic rotation
    - Enhanced security with External ID validation
    - Fine-grained permission control via IAM policies

    <Warning>
    Your credentials are encrypted and stored securely using industry-standard encryption.
    </Warning>

  <Tab title="GCP Setup">
    **Required Information:**
    1. **Service Account Key**: JSON key file from your GCP service account
    2. **Project ID**: Your Google Cloud project identifier
    
    **Setup Instructions:**
    - Create a service account in GCP Console
    - Download the JSON key file
    - Grant minimal required permissions
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Azure Setup">
    **Required Credentials:**
    1. **Client ID**: Azure application client ID  
    2. **Client Secret**: Azure application secret
    3. **Tenant ID**: Your Azure AD tenant ID
    4. **Subscription ID**: Target Azure subscription
    
    **Prerequisites:**
    - Register an application in Azure AD
    - Grant appropriate RBAC permissions
    - Generate client secret
  </Tab>
