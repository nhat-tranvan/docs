CloudThinker is a **Multi-Agents (MAS)** that automates cloud operations through specialized AI agents. Five expert agents—each with deep domain knowledge—work autonomously and collaboratively to optimize cost, security, performance, and reliability across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

```bash
@alex analyze EC2 instances with <20% CPU utilization over 30 days
@oliver audit security groups for public access on database ports
@tony #dashboard database performance metrics for production cluster
@kai optimize pod resource allocation across all namespaces
@anna coordinate quarterly infrastructure review with all agents
```

## The Agents

Five specialized agents, each an expert in their domain:

| Agent | Role | Primary Focus |
|-------|------|---------------|
| **Alex** | Cloud Engineer | Cost optimization, infrastructure, multi-cloud architecture |
| **Oliver** | Security Professional | Compliance, vulnerabilities, threat detection, IAM |
| **Tony** | Database Engineer | Query optimization, performance tuning, data analytics |
| **Kai** | Kubernetes Engineer | Container orchestration, cluster optimization, workloads |
| **Anna** | General Manager | Multi-agent coordination, complex projects, executive reporting |

## Core Capabilities

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Infrastructure Intelligence" icon="server">
    Discover resources, run Well-Architected assessments, and execute recommendations automatically
  </Card>
  <Card title="Continuous Optimization" icon="chart-line">
    Agents monitor, analyze, and optimize 24/7 without manual intervention
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Cloud Unified" icon="cloud">
    Single interface for AWS, Azure, and GCP with consistent operations across providers
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Link your cloud accounts with read-only credentials. Agents discover your infrastructure automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prompt">
    Use natural language with `@agent` mentions and `#tool` commands to request analysis or actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute">
    Agents analyze, recommend, and—with your approval—implement optimizations autonomously.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Three layers power CloudThinker:

- **Application Layer**: Console, API, SDK, Slack integration
- **MAS Orchestration**: Agents, Knowledge Base, Connectors, Perception Tools
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Cloud providers, databases, Kubernetes clusters

## What You Can Do

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cost Optimization">
    ```bash
    @alex analyze spending trends over last quarter
    @alex #recommend reserved instance purchases for stable workloads
    @alex identify unattached volumes and unused elastic IPs
    ```

    **Typical outcome**: 30-40% cost reduction with automated implementation plans
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Security & Compliance">
    ```bash
    @oliver perform SOC 2 Type II compliance assessment
    @oliver audit IAM policies for privilege escalation risks
    @oliver #report security posture with remediation timeline
    ```

    **Typical outcome**: 90%+ compliance score with complete audit trail
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Database Performance">
    ```bash
    @tony analyze slow queries on production PostgreSQL
    @tony #dashboard query performance with P95 latency trends
    @tony recommend index optimizations for high-frequency queries
    ```

    **Typical outcome**: 70% query performance improvement
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Kubernetes Operations">
    ```bash
    @kai analyze pod resource utilization across all clusters
    @kai identify nodes with <30% CPU utilization for consolidation
    @kai #recommend HPA policies for variable workloads
    ```

    **Typical outcome**: 25% cost reduction with improved reliability
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Complex Operations">
    ```bash
    @anna coordinate AWS to Azure migration with all agents
    @anna #report quarterly infrastructure review for executive team
    @anna manage security remediation project across @oliver @alex @kai
    ```

    **Typical outcome**: 75% faster project completion with unified visibility
