CloudThinker uses a natural language interface enhanced with structured syntax. This guide is the definitive reference for communicating effectively with agents.

---

## Syntax Overview

Every CloudThinker prompt follows this structure:

```
@agent [instruction] [#tool] [context]
```

| Component | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `@agent` | Yes | Routes the request to a specific agent |
| `instruction` | Yes | What you want the agent to do |
| `#tool` | No | Output format or capability to use |
| `context` | No | Constraints, timeframes, scope |

---

## Agent Mentions

Use `@` to direct requests to specific agents:

| Agent | Expertise | When to Use |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `@alex` | Cloud infrastructure, cost, performance | Cost analysis, resource optimization, multi-cloud |
| `@oliver` | Security, compliance, threats | Audits, vulnerability scans, IAM, compliance |
| `@tony` | Databases, queries, analytics | Query optimization, performance tuning, backups |
| `@kai` | Kubernetes, containers, orchestration | Cluster management, pod optimization, scaling |
| `@anna` | Coordination, strategy, reporting | Multi-agent projects, executive reports, complex ops |

### Single Agent

```bash
@alex analyze EC2 spending trends over the last quarter
@oliver audit all S3 buckets for public access
@tony identify queries with execution time >2 seconds
@kai check pod resource utilization in production namespace
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

Address multiple agents for complex problems:

```bash
@alex @tony investigate cost spike on database infrastructure
@oliver @kai audit Kubernetes RBAC and network policies
@anna coordinate security remediation across @oliver @alex @kai
```

---

## Tool Commands

Use `#` to specify output format or invoke specific capabilities:

| Tool | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `#dashboard` | Interactive visualizations | `@alex #dashboard monthly cost trends` |
| `#report` | Detailed analysis documents | `@oliver #report SOC 2 compliance assessment` |
| `#recommend` | Actionable recommendations | `@tony #recommend index optimizations` |
| `#alert` | Monitoring notifications | `@kai #alert when node CPU >80%` |
| `#chart` | Data visualizations | `@alex #chart spending by service` |
| `#kb` | Knowledge base search | `@alex #kb AWS cost optimization policies` |

### Tool Combinations

Combine tools with agent mentions:

```bash
@alex #dashboard #recommend cost optimization opportunities
@oliver #report #alert security findings requiring immediate action
@tony #dashboard database performance with #alert on P95 >500ms
```

### Tool-Specific Patterns

    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="#kb">
    Searches your organization's knowledge base.

    ```bash
    # Policy searches
    @alex #kb cloud governance policies
    @oliver #kb:security-policies incident response procedures

    @tony #kb PostgreSQL optimization best practices
    @kai #kb Kubernetes deployment standards
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Context Modifiers

Add context to narrow scope and improve accuracy:

### Timeframes

```bash
@alex analyze spending over the last 30 days
@alex compare costs: last month vs same period last year
@tony identify slow queries from the past week
@oliver find security group changes in the last 24 hours
```

### Scope

```bash
@alex analyze EC2 instances in us-east-1 region
@oliver audit production environment security groups
@tony check performance on the orders database
@kai review staging cluster resource allocation
```

### Thresholds

```bash
@alex identify instances with CPU utilization <15%
@tony find queries with execution time >2 seconds
@kai flag pods requesting >2GB memory but using <500MB
@oliver find IAM roles with >50 attached policies
```

### Exclusions

```bash
@alex recommend terminations excluding production-tagged resources
@oliver audit all buckets except backup-* prefixed ones
@tony analyze all databases excluding read replicas
```

### Priorities

```bash
@alex #recommend cost savings prioritizing quick wins under 30 days
@oliver identify vulnerabilities, critical severity first
@tony optimize queries prioritizing those running >100x daily
```

### Combined Context

```bash
@alex analyze EC2 instances in us-east-1
  with CPU <20% over last 30 days
  excluding production-critical
  #recommend right-sizing with projected savings

@oliver audit security groups in production
  for public access on ports 22, 3389, 3306
  #report with remediation timeline
  prioritizing internet-facing resources
```

## Prompt Patterns

### Pattern 1: Analysis Request

```
@agent analyze [target] [context]
```

```bash
@alex analyze EC2 spending by instance family over last quarter
@tony analyze query patterns on production PostgreSQL cluster
@kai analyze pod scheduling efficiency across all nodes
@oliver analyze IAM permission usage for service accounts
```

### Pattern 2: Audit Request

```
@agent audit [target] for [criteria]
```

```bash
@oliver audit S3 buckets for public access and encryption
@oliver audit IAM policies for privilege escalation paths
@alex audit infrastructure for unused or orphaned resources
@kai audit RBAC configuration against least-privilege principles
```

### Pattern 3: Optimization Request

```
@agent optimize/recommend [target] [constraints]
```

```bash
@alex recommend cost optimizations maintaining 99.9% availability
@tony recommend index changes for queries >500ms execution time
@kai optimize pod resource requests based on actual utilization
```

### Pattern 4: Investigation Request

```
@agent investigate [issue] [scope]
```

```bash
@alex investigate cost spike on database services last week
@tony investigate slow query performance on orders table
@kai investigate pod crash loops in payment namespace
@oliver investigate failed authentication attempts from unusual IPs
```

### Pattern 5: Coordination Request

```
@anna coordinate [project] with @agents [scope]
```

```bash
@anna coordinate AWS to GCP migration with @alex @tony @kai
@anna coordinate security remediation with @oliver leading, @alex @kai supporting
@anna coordinate quarterly review: @alex cost, @oliver security, @tony databases, @kai containers
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Progressive Refinement

Start broad, then drill down based on findings:

```bash
# Step 1: Broad overview
@alex #dashboard cloud spending trends

# Step 2: Identify problem area
@alex which services drove the November cost spike?

# Step 3: Deep dive
@alex break down RDS costs by instance type and utilization

# Step 4: Actionable recommendation
@alex #recommend RDS optimization prioritizing underutilized instances
```

### Comparative Analysis

Ask agents to compare options:

```bash
@alex compare reserved instances vs savings plans for our EC2 usage pattern

@tony compare these approaches for database scaling:
  1. Read replicas
  2. Sharding by customer_id
  3. Migration to Aurora Serverless
  Include: cost, complexity, performance impact

@oliver compare SOC 2 vs ISO 27001 based on our customer requirements
```

### Conditional Logic

Apply business rules to recommendations:

```bash
@alex #recommend instance right-sizing where:
  - CPU utilization <20% for >14 days
  - Not tagged as burst-capable
  - Not in auto-scaling groups
  - Savings >$50/month

@oliver prioritize security findings:
  - Critical: internet-exposed + known CVE
  - High: production + public access
  - Medium: everything else
```

### Structured Requests

For complex requirements, use structured format:

```bash
@tony optimize database performance:
  Target: production PostgreSQL cluster
  Focus: queries running >100x daily with >500ms P95
  Constraints:
    - No schema changes requiring downtime
    - Maintain read replica compatibility
  Output: #recommend with implementation order and rollback plan
```

## Slack Integration

In Slack, prefix with `@CloudThinker`:

```bash
@CloudThinker alex what's our AWS spending this week?
@CloudThinker oliver any critical security findings?
@CloudThinker tony why are queries slow on production?
@CloudThinker kai check EKS cluster health
```

All syntax works identically in Slack—just add the `@CloudThinker` prefix.
