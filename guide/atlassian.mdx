# Atlassian Integration Settings

Control which AI tools can connect to your Atlassian organization. You can allow or block these integrations to prevent unauthorized access.

These settings work alongside your existing security controls like IP allowlisting and app management policies.

<Note>
**Prerequisites**
- **Role:** Organization Admin
- **Supported Plans:** Atlassian Cloud (Free, Standard, Premium, Enterprise)
</Note>

## Manage Domains

### Allow CloudThinker Domain

To allow CloudThinker to connect to your Atlassian organization, you must add our domain to the allowed list.

1. Go to [Atlassian Administration](https://admin.atlassian.com) > **Apps** > **AI settings** > **Rovo MCP server**.
2. Select **Add domain**.
3. Enter `https://cloudthinker.io/**` and save.

## IP Allowlisting

If your organization uses IP allowlisting:
- Configure allowlists in **Atlassian Administration** (not in AI settings).
- Requests must come from allowed IPs, even for trusted domains.
- Users on blocked IPs will see a permission error.

## Disclaimer

<Warning>
Atlassian Integration clients act with your existing user permissions. Always use least privilege and monitor audit logs for suspicious activity.
</Warning>
