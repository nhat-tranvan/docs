Transform your Slack workspace into a cloud operations command center. Interact with CloudThinker agents, receive alerts, and run operations without leaving Slack.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install App">
    Go to **Settings → Integrations → Slack** in CloudThinker and click **Add to Slack**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Select your Slack workspace and authorize CloudThinker
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Channel">
    Add the CloudThinker app to your desired channels
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test">
    Try `@CloudThinker alex show AWS costs` to verify
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Syntax

In Slack, prefix all commands with `@CloudThinker`:

```bash
@CloudThinker alex analyze EC2 spending trends
@CloudThinker oliver audit security groups for public access
@CloudThinker tony check database performance
@CloudThinker kai review EKS cluster health
```

All [CloudThinker Language](/guide/language) syntax works in Slack—just add the `@CloudThinker` prefix.

## Examples

### Quick Queries

```bash
@CloudThinker alex what's our AWS spending this week?
@CloudThinker oliver any critical security findings?
@CloudThinker tony why are queries slow on production?
@CloudThinker kai check pod status in payment namespace
```

### With Tools

```bash
@CloudThinker alex #dashboard cost trends by service
@CloudThinker oliver #report weekly security summary
@CloudThinker tony #recommend index optimizations
@CloudThinker kai #alert on pod OOMKilled events
```

### Multi-Agent

```bash
@CloudThinker anna coordinate investigation of latency spike
@CloudThinker alex and tony analyze database infrastructure costs
```

---

## Alerts

Configure agents to send alerts to Slack channels:

```bash
@CloudThinker alex #alert daily spend exceeds $5,000 → #cloud-ops
@CloudThinker oliver #alert security group changes → #security
@CloudThinker kai #alert pod failures in production → #k8s-alerts
```

## Channel Patterns

| Channel | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `#cloud-ops` | General infrastructure operations and cost alerts |
| `#security` | Security findings and compliance updates |
| `#incidents` | Active incident investigation and coordination |
| `#reports` | Scheduled reports and summaries |

---

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Agents not responding">
- Check if CloudThinker app is added to the channel
- Verify you're using `@CloudThinker agent` syntax (not just `agent`)
- Confirm agents are configured in CloudThinker console
- Try `/cloudthinker status` to check connection
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing alerts">
- Check alert configuration in CloudThinker Settings
- Verify Slack channel notification settings
- Test with `/cloudthinker alerts test`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission errors">
- Re-install CloudThinker Slack app
- Check workspace admin permissions
- Remove and re-add app to channels
</Accordion>

## Permissions

CloudThinker in Slack uses your workspace's CloudThinker permissions. Users can only access agents and connections their CloudThinker account permits.
