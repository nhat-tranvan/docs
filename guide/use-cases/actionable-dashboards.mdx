## **The evolution of data visualization in cloud operations**

Traditional BI platforms were designed for slow-changing data and long reporting cycles. However, modern cloud environments operate at a high velocity where infrastructure scales dynamically and performance shifts in minutes. This speed demands visualization capabilities that match the pace of change, providing instant visibility into system patterns and resource utilization. Beyond speed, the challenge is accessibility—traditional visualization is often siloed among specialists, creating significant organizational bottlenecks.

## **Challenges with traditional reporting workflows**

**Manual delays**: Reports require SQL writing, data export, visualization configuration, and review cycles by completion, data represents historical rather than current state

**Siloed expertise**: Business teams depend on DBAs or analysts with competing priorities and limited capacity, limiting iterative exploration

**Cross-system correlation**: Modern applications span multiple databases and AWS services (RDS, Cost Explorer, CloudWatch, custom databases), each requiring different credentials, query languages, and export formats consuming hours or days of specialist time

## **Solution: CloudThinker's agentic approach to data visualization**

CloudThinker uses specialized AI agents that understand natural language and technical infrastructure, delivering dashboards in minutes. This approach breaks down traditional silos by automatically gathering data from across your entire ecosystem—without requiring users to know which systems to query or how to correlate the information.

## **Implementing ad-hoc visualization with CloudThinker**

CloudThinker provides secure, read-only access across your entire cloud environment, turning natural language prompts into precise, actionable dashboards instantly.

### **Intelligent Agent Capabilities**

Instead of manual configuration, CloudThinker's agents automatically map your requests to the relevant data, providing expertise across three core areas:

- **Performance & Health:** Instantly analyze system metrics and workload efficiency to pinpoint bottlenecks and maintain peak performance.
- **Resource & Cost Operations:** Gain deep visibility into utilization patterns and spending trends to ensure your entire ecosystem remains cost-effective.
- **Cross-Domain Intelligence:** Connect the dots across your technical stack, correlating performance data with operational impact for a truly holistic view.

With CloudThinker, you no longer need to worry about where your data lives. Simply describe the insight you need, and the agents handle the complexity to deliver the results.

### **Mastering perception commands and prompt patterns**

CloudThinker uses three primary perception commands. Here are proven prompt templates for each:

**AWS Cost Analysis:**

```
@alex #dashboard

Generate a comprehensive AWS cost dashboard analyzing the period [start_date] to [end_date].

Include:
- Monthly spending trends by service with MoM growth rates
- RDS Aurora and DocumentDB cost breakdown (compute, storage, I/O, backup)
- Top 10 cost drivers and their utilization patterns
- Reserved Instance vs On-Demand cost comparison
- Cost anomalies and unexpected spending spikes
- Cost optimization opportunities with estimated savings

Segment by: [cost allocation tags like environment, team, or application]
```

</Frame>
<p style={{textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '0.9em', color: '#666', marginTop: '8px'}}>AWS cost dashboard with spending trends and cost drivers</p>

**Cross-Domain Database & Infrastructure Analysis:**

```
@anna dashboard

Create an integrated operational dashboard correlating database performance with infrastructure costs for [time_period].

Analyze:
- Aurora and DocumentDB query performance metrics
- AWS resource utilization and spending patterns
- Correlation between database load and compute/storage costs
- Impact of database performance issues on overall infrastructure spending
- Recommendations for optimizing both performance and cost efficiency

Context: [describe recent changes, migrations, or specific concerns]
```

</Frame>
<p style={{textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '0.9em', color: '#666', marginTop: '8px'}}>Database and infrastructure correlation dashboard</p>

#### **Chart Command Patterns**

The chart command generates focused visualizations for specific analyses:

**Aurora Query Performance Time-Series:**

```
@tony chart

Display a time-series chart showing query execution time trends for Aurora cluster [cluster-identifier] over the past [time_period].

Parameters:
- Group by: [hour/day/week]
- Metrics: p50, p95, p99 query latency
- Separate lines for: read queries vs write queries
- Highlight: queries exceeding [threshold]ms
- Overlay: Aurora version upgrades or configuration changes

Filter: [specific databases or query patterns if needed]
```

</Frame>
<p style={{textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '0.9em', color: '#666', marginTop: '8px'}}>Aurora query performance time-series chart</p>

**Parameterized Templates for Recurring Analysis:**

Create reusable templates for common investigations:

```
Template: database_performance_review
Agent: @tony
Command: dashboard

Create a performance dashboard for Aurora cluster {cluster_id} covering {time_period}.

Include:
- Slow query analysis (queries exceeding {latency_threshold}ms)
- Resource utilization trends (CPU, memory, IOPS)
- Replica lag monitoring
- Connection pool health

Compare against baseline: {comparison_period}
Alert on: queries exceeding p95 latency of {latency_threshold}ms

Usage example:
database_performance_review
 cluster_id=production-aurora-cluster
 time_period="past 7 days"
 comparison_period="previous 30 days"
 latency_threshold=200
```

</Frame>
<p style={{textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '0.9em', color: '#666', marginTop: '8px'}}>Performance review dashboard template</p>

```
Template: cost_anomaly_investigation
Agent: @alex
Command: report

Investigate cost anomaly for {service_name} on {date}.

Analysis:
- Compare costs to 7-day average and 30-day average
- Break down by cost component (compute, storage, I/O, data transfer)
- Correlate with resource utilization changes
- Identify specific resources driving the increase
- Provide cost impact quantification

Recommend: Immediate actions to mitigate ongoing cost increases

Usage example:
cost_anomaly_investigation
 service_name="Amazon RDS"
 date="2024-01-15"
```
