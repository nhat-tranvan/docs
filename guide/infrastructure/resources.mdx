title: Resources
description: Infrastructure resources overview for CloudThinker operations.
---

Track every cloud asset, run targeted discovery, and act on cost/security/performance findings in one place. Screenshots use AWS as an example, but flows apply to any supported cloud.

---

## What you get

- Complete inventory across accounts with resource type filters and tags
- On-demand and continuous discovery across AWS services
- Inline actions to optimize cost, scan security, and check performance

---

## Prerequisites

- At least one cloud account connected (images show AWS, but any supported cloud works)
- Tags you want to use for scoping (e.g., `ENV=dev`, `Environment=production`)

---

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Resources">
    Go to **Infrastructure → Resources** to start discovery.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select cloud & services">
    Choose the account, pick service types to scan, and scope with tags.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review inventory">
    See discovered assets, savings potential, and run actions per resource.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How access and automation work

- Agents can operate on any resources your cloud permissions allow, not just the ones you discovered. Discovery makes it easier to manage those resources inside CloudThinker.
- **CloudKeepers** runs across all permitted resources in your cloud; it is not limited by resource discovery scope.
- **Assessment** requires discovered resources first and only evaluates the resources that have been discovered.

## Step-by-step guide

### Step 1: Launch discovery
<Steps>
  <Step title="Launch discovery">
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/infrastructure/resources/1-resource-discovery-landing.jpg"
        alt="Resources landing with Connect AWS CTA and how-it-works timeline"
      />
    </Frame>
    Click **Connect** for your cloud (AWS shown here) and start **Resource Discovery**.
    The banner shows the flow: connect, run first scan (~30s), then automate.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Pick services to scan
<Steps>
  <Step title="Pick services to scan">
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/infrastructure/resources/2-resource-discovery-services.jpg"
        alt="Service selection modal with AWS service tiles"
      />
    </Frame>
    Choose the services you want to include (names vary by cloud; AWS shown in the screenshot). Use **Select All** or search to narrow, then save when it matches your discovery scope.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Scope by tags
<Steps>
  <Step title="Scope by tags">
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/infrastructure/resources/3-resource-discovery-tags.jpg"
        alt="Environment tag filters for resource discovery"
      />
    </Frame>
    - **No selected tags** → scan all tags/resources.
    - **Selecting tags** → only resources matching those tags are scanned.
    Add environment tags (e.g., `ENV=dev`, `Environment=production`) or **Add Custom Tag** for teams/projects/cost centers to focus the crawl.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Review inventory and act
<Steps>
  <Step title="Review inventory and act">
    <Frame>
      <img
        src="/images/infrastructure/resources/4-resource-inventory-table.jpg"
        alt="Resource inventory with savings and inline actions"
      />
    </Frame>
    - See totals, potential savings, and per-resource entries.
    - Filter by resource name, service, or category (e.g., Compute).
    - Hover **Actions** to run **Optimize Cost**, **Scan Security**, or **Check Performance** on a resource.
    Use this to triage new findings and trigger targeted actions quickly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips

- Start broad, then narrow with tags to avoid missing critical resources.
- Keep discovery configurations versioned (note which services/tags you scan).
- After each scan, action high-value recommendations first (cost/security).
