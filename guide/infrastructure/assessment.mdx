## Prerequisites

- A cloud connection with the permissions your agents need to assess resources.
- Resources already discovered in CloudThinker; assessments only evaluate discovered resources.
- Optional: tag or resource filters ready if you want to scope the run.

<Note>
  Assessments are limited to discovered resources. CloudKeepers automations
  still operate across any resources you permit in your cloud connection.
