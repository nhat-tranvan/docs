Plan is the central workspace for managing findings (recommendations) across CloudThinker. Items generated by CloudKeepers, Assessments, and the `#recommended` tool in conversations start as drafts—you must manually save them for them to appear in Plan. From there, propose actions, estimate impact, capture approvals, and schedule rollouts across environments.

## Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Plan">
    Go to **Plan** to see all saved recommendations ready for execution.

        alt="Plan overview with recommendations list"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save findings to Plan">
    Open any draft finding from CloudKeepers, Assessments, or `#recommended` conversation results and choose **Save to Plan**. Saved items become available for approvals, scheduling, and execution. Unsaved drafts remain in their source views and will not show in Plan.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter recommendations (optional)">
    Use **More Filters** to scope by resource name, pillar, service, assessment, or source. This helps focus the rollout before approvals and scheduling.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="View recommendation details">
    Open a recommendation to review impact analysis, savings, risk notes, and implementation guidance before deciding what to run.

        alt="Recommendation detail with impact analysis and implementation guidance"
      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Take action">
    Choose how to proceed: run impact analytics, generate guidelines, ask a custom prompt, request approvals, or implement directly.
