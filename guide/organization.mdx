Organizations are the top-level entity in CloudThinker that groups your workspaces, team members, and billing under a single account. Every user automatically gets a personal organization when they sign up.

## Overview

Organizations in CloudThinker provide:

- **Centralized Billing**: Single subscription and usage quota shared across all workspaces
- **Team Management**: Invite members and assign roles across your organization
- **Workspace Container**: Create multiple workspaces within your organization
- **BYOK Support**: Configure your own AWS Bedrock credentials at the organization level

<Info>
  Every CloudThinker user automatically receives a personal organization upon
  signup. This organization is named after you (e.g., "John's Organization") and
  serves as your default workspace container.

<Info>
  When editing workspace access for Developers or Viewers, you can also set a
  role override per workspace. This allows a Viewer to have Developer access in
  specific workspaces, or a Developer to have Admin access where needed.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Removing a member from the organization removes them from all workspaces
  within that organization.
</Warning>

## Subscription & Billing

Organization Owners can manage subscription and view usage from the Subscription tab.

### Subscription Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Plan Overview" icon="credit-card">
    **Subscription Details** - Current plan and features - Billing cycle
    information - Payment method management - Upgrade/downgrade options
  </Card>
  <Card title="Usage Tracking" icon="chart-line">
    **Monitor Consumption** - Credit usage across all workspaces - Member count
    vs. limit - Workspace count vs. limit - Usage trends over time
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Member Limits

Your subscription plan determines how many members you can have:

- **Starter Plan**: Limited members (check your plan details)
- **Advanced Plan**: Unlimited members

The member count includes both active members and pending invitations.

## BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)

Organization Owners can configure AWS Bedrock credentials to use their own LLM quota instead of CloudThinker's shared pool.

<Accordion title="What is BYOK?">
**Bring Your Own Key** allows you to:
- Use your own AWS Bedrock account for LLM calls
- Bypass CloudThinker's credit system for LLM usage
- Have unlimited LLM operations (based on your AWS quota)
- Maintain data residency in your own AWS account

BYOK is configured at the organization level and applies to all workspaces.

## Best Practices

### Team Structure

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Role Assignment" icon="users-gear">
    **Principle of Least Privilege** - Assign Owner role sparingly (1-2 people)
    - Use Admin for team leads who need workspace management - Use Developer for
    most team members - Use Viewer for stakeholders who need visibility only
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workspace Access" icon="folder-tree">
    **Organized Access** - Admins/Owners see all workspaces automatically -
    Explicitly assign Developers to relevant workspaces - Use role overrides for
    fine-grained control per workspace - Regular access reviews for compliance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Common Patterns

<Accordion title="Small Team (2-5 members)">
  **Simple Structure:** - 1 Owner (team lead or account holder) - 1-2 Admins
  (senior engineers) - Remaining as Developers - Single workspace or dev/prod
  split
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Medium Team (5-20 members)">
  **Structured Approach:** - 1 Owner (engineering manager) - 2-3 Admins (tech
  leads) - Developers assigned to relevant workspaces - Viewers for product
  managers or stakeholders - Multiple workspaces by environment or team
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Enterprise Team (20+ members)">
  **Governance Focus:** - 1-2 Owners (platform team leads) - Admins per team or
  department - Developers with workspace-specific access - Viewers for audit and
  compliance - Workspaces by team, environment, and project - Consider BYOK for
  cost control
</Accordion>
