## Configuration Interface

<Frame caption="Main Notifications settings page with Slack notification channel configuration">
  <img

    alt="Notifications main settings page showing Slack notification channel configuration"
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

The notification system organizes around CloudThinker's core features, allowing independent configuration for each area. Access comprehensive settings by selecting each feature category.

### Feature Categories

Configure notifications independently for each area:

- **Alerts** - Critical and operational alert notifications for system events
- **Agents & Tasks** - Agent interruptions and task completions
- **Code Review / Pipeline Monitoring** - Pipeline execution status and failure notifications
- **CloudKeepers / Assessment** - Cost optimization recommendations and AWS assessment updates
- **Discussions** - Team discussion activity, replies, and resolved discussions
- **Resources** - Infrastructure resource changes and updates

---

## Channel Configuration

Each feature category supports flexible channel configuration with independent control:

### Email Notifications

<Frame caption="Add multiple email addresses for notifications with verification">
  <img
    src="/images/notification-center/06-email-recipients-form.webp"
    alt="Email recipients input form showing how to add multiple email addresses for notifications"
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

Send notifications to verified email addresses, supporting both workspace members and external recipients.

**Key Features:**

- Verified external recipients for security
- Multiple email addresses per feature
- Workspace member defaults
- Email verification required for external addresses

### Slack Integration

<Frame caption="Select Slack channels for routing notifications to your team">
  <img
    src="/images/notification-center/08-slack-channel-selection.webp"
    alt="Slack channel dropdown selector showing available channels for notification routing"
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

Route notifications to Slack channels instead of direct messages, reducing notification fatigue while maintaining team awareness.

**Key Features:**

- Channel-based routing (not direct messages)
- Reduces notification overload
- Team-wide visibility and opt-in
- Context-aware channel selection

## Severity Filtering

<Frame caption="Configure severity thresholds for Alerts notifications via email and Slack">
  <img
    src="/images/notification-center/03-alerts-configuration.webp"
    alt="Alerts section showing email and Slack severity filter controls with High and Medium thresholds"
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }}
  />
</Frame>

Filter notifications by severity level to receive only alerts meeting your threshold:

- **Low** - Informational updates and general notifications
- **Medium** - Important updates requiring attention and review
- **High** - Critical issues affecting operations that need prompt action
- **Critical** - System-critical alerts requiring immediate action

Each channel can have independent severity thresholds. For example, configure Slack for Medium and above while Email is set to High and above.

</Frame>

Notifications for team collaboration activities:

- **Replies** - When someone replies directly to one of your comments
- **Resolved Discussions** - When a discussion you're involved in is marked as resolved

---

## Key Features

### Email Verification

To prevent unauthorized access and data leakage, external email recipients must be verified before receiving notifications:

1. Enter the external email address in the notification settings
2. A verification link is sent to that email address
3. The recipient must click the verification link to confirm
4. Only verified addresses receive workspace notifications

This ensures that sensitive cloud operations data is only distributed to intended recipients.

### Slack Channel-Based Routing

Instead of sending direct messages to individual users, notifications route to Slack channels:

- **Better Context** - All team members can see notifications in the channel
- **Reduced Fatigue** - Single channel per feature instead of individual messages
- **Opt-In Subscriptions** - Team members can choose to join specific notification channels
- **Team Awareness** - Operations visibility across your team

### Multi-Workspace Support

Configure separate notification preferences for each workspace you belong to:

- Different severity thresholds per workspace
- Role-specific configurations
- Workspace-specific channels
- Tailored alert strategies based on workspace context

---

## Best Practices

### Reducing Alert Fatigue

- **Configure severity filters appropriately** - Set High or Critical for roles that manage many features
- **Use Slack channels** - Route team notifications to channels instead of direct messages
- **Disable unused features** - Turn off notifications for features your team doesn't actively manage
- **Gradual enablement** - Start with Critical alerts, then gradually add lower severity levels

### Security Considerations

- **Always verify external emails** - Ensure only authorized recipients have access to sensitive data
- **Use workspace-specific channels** - Route sensitive operations to dedicated Slack channels
- **Review recipients regularly** - Periodically audit who receives notifications
- **Restrict channel access** - Limit notification channel membership to relevant team members
- **Monitor notification activity** - Track who receives what notifications for compliance

### Configuration Strategy

1. **Start with Critical + High severity** for critical operational alerts
2. **Gradually add Medium severity** as your team becomes familiar with the system
3. **Use different channels for different features** - Keep infrastructure alerts separate from cost alerts
4. **Tailor by role** - Adjust thresholds based on team member responsibilities
5. **Test notification delivery** - Verify emails and Slack messages are reaching intended recipients
