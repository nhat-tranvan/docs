## Prompt Patterns

### Query Analysis

```bash
# Slow query investigation
@tony analyze slow queries on production PostgreSQL

# Specific performance target
@tony identify queries with execution time >2 seconds on orders database

# Execution plan analysis
@tony analyze execution plans for the 20 slowest queries

# Query patterns
@tony find queries that could benefit from caching
```

### Performance Optimization

```bash
# Index recommendations
@tony analyze missing indexes that would improve performance by >10%

# Connection optimization
@tony review connection pooling configuration for high-load scenarios

# Configuration tuning
@tony optimize MySQL 8.0 configuration for high-throughput OLTP with 10k connections

# Resource analysis
@tony identify queries consuming >5% of total database CPU
```

### Database Health

```bash
# Health check
@tony check database health and performance metrics

# Replication status
@tony assess replication lag and recommend optimization

# Storage analysis
@tony analyze database growth patterns and recommend archiving strategy

# Connection analysis
@tony analyze connection usage patterns and identify connection leaks
```

### Backup & Recovery

```bash
# Backup verification
@tony verify backup status and recovery procedures for production databases

# DR planning
@tony create disaster recovery plan with RTO/RPO analysis

# Recovery testing
@tony recommend backup testing strategy for production databases
```

## Tool Usage

| Tool | Tony Use Case |
|------|---------------|
| `#dashboard` | Query latency (P50/P95/P99), connections, I/O, replication lag |
| `#report` | Performance analysis, optimization recommendations, capacity planning |
| `#recommend` | Index changes, configuration updates, query rewrites |
| `#alert` | Slow queries, connection pool exhaustion, replication lag |
| `#chart` | Query trends, resource utilization, growth patterns |

### Examples with Tools

```bash
@tony #dashboard database performance metrics for production cluster
@tony #report query performance analysis with optimization plan
@tony #recommend index optimizations prioritized by impact
@tony #alert when P95 query latency exceeds 500ms
```

  <Card title="Include Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    ```bash
    # Good
    @tony analyze queries with
    execution time >2 seconds
    running >100 times daily

    # Avoid
    @tony make database faster
    ```
  </Card>
  <Card title="Specify Platform" icon="database">
    ```bash
    # Good
    @tony optimize MySQL 8.0
    for read-heavy workloads
    with 10k concurrent connections

## Connection Requirements

Tony requires database connections with performance metrics access:

| Platform | Required Access |
|----------|----------------|
| **PostgreSQL** | `pg_stat_statements`, query logs, performance schema |
| **MySQL** | Performance Schema, slow query log, status variables |
| **RDS/Aurora** | Enhanced Monitoring, Performance Insights |
| **MongoDB** | Profiler, `serverStatus`, operation logs |

## Common Workflows

### Performance Crisis Response

```bash
# Step 1: Identify
@tony identify top 10 slowest queries in last hour

# Step 2: Analyze
@tony analyze execution plans for problematic queries

# Step 3: Optimize
@tony #recommend index changes and query rewrites

# Step 4: Monitor
@tony #dashboard real-time query performance
```

### Proactive Optimization

```bash
# Step 1: Baseline
@tony #dashboard current performance metrics

# Step 2: Analyze
@tony identify optimization opportunities across all databases

# Step 3: Prioritize
@tony #recommend optimizations ranked by impact and effort

# Step 4: Automate
@tony #schedule weekly performance review
```

### Capacity Planning

```bash
# Step 1: Analyze growth
@tony analyze database growth patterns over last 6 months

# Step 2: Forecast
@tony predict storage and compute needs for next year

# Step 3: Plan
@tony #recommend scaling strategy with cost analysis
```
