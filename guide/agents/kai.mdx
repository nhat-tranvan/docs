## Prompt Patterns

### Cluster Health

```bash
# Health check
@kai check EKS cluster health and pod distribution

# Resource utilization
@kai analyze cluster resource utilization and identify bottlenecks

# Node analysis
@kai identify nodes with <30% CPU utilization for consolidation

# Multi-cluster view
@kai provide health summary across all Kubernetes clusters
```

### Workload Optimization

```bash
# Pod right-sizing
@kai analyze pod resource requests/limits and recommend right-sizing

# Scheduling efficiency
@kai identify pods with resource requests far exceeding actual usage

# Cost optimization
@kai identify underutilized nodes and recommend consolidation strategy

# Namespace analysis
@kai analyze resource allocation across namespaces
```

### Autoscaling

```bash
# HPA review
@kai review Horizontal Pod Autoscaler policies and recommend improvements

# Scaling analysis
@kai analyze scaling patterns and recommend threshold adjustments

# VPA assessment
@kai evaluate whether Vertical Pod Autoscaler would benefit our workloads

# Cluster autoscaling
@kai review Cluster Autoscaler configuration for cost efficiency
```

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Crash investigation
@kai investigate pod crash loops in payment namespace

# OOM analysis
@kai identify pods experiencing OOMKilled events and recommend fixes

# Scheduling issues
@kai analyze pending pods and identify scheduling constraints

# Network problems
@kai investigate network connectivity issues between services
```

### Security

```bash
# RBAC audit
@kai audit RBAC configuration against least-privilege principles

# Network policies
@kai analyze network policies and recommend security improvements

# Pod security
@kai identify pods running with excessive privileges

# Secrets audit
@kai audit secrets management and recommend rotation strategy
```

## Tool Usage

| Tool | Kai Use Case |
|------|--------------|
| `#dashboard` | Cluster health, node status, resource utilization, pod metrics |
| `#report` | Optimization analysis, security audits, capacity planning |
| `#recommend` | Right-sizing, scaling policies, consolidation actions |
| `#alert` | OOMKills, node pressure, pod failures, resource thresholds |
| `#chart` | Resource trends, scaling patterns, utilization over time |

### Examples with Tools

```bash
@kai #dashboard EKS cluster health with node and pod metrics
@kai #report cluster optimization opportunities with implementation plan
@kai #recommend HPA policies for variable workloads
@kai #alert on pod OOMKilled events or node pressure conditions
```

## Connection Requirements

Kai requires Kubernetes cluster access with monitoring capabilities:

| Component | Required Access |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Kubernetes API** | Read access to pods, nodes, deployments, services |
| **Metrics Server** | Resource metrics for pods and nodes |
| **Events** | Cluster events for troubleshooting |
| **Logs** | Container logs for debugging |

---

## Common Workflows

### Cluster Optimization

```bash
# Step 1: Assess
@kai analyze cluster resource utilization

# Step 2: Identify waste
@kai identify pods with >50% overprovisioned resources

# Step 3: Plan
@kai #recommend right-sizing with zero-downtime approach

# Step 4: Monitor
@kai #dashboard track resource utilization after changes
```

### Incident Response

```bash
# Step 1: Identify
@kai identify unhealthy pods and failing deployments

# Step 2: Investigate
@kai analyze logs and events for root cause

# Step 3: Remediate
@kai #recommend immediate actions to restore service

# Step 4: Prevent
@kai #recommend changes to prevent recurrence
```

### Capacity Planning

```bash
# Step 1: Baseline
@kai analyze current resource consumption patterns

# Step 2: Project
@kai forecast resource needs for 2x growth

# Step 3: Plan
@kai #recommend node pool configuration for projected growth

# Step 4: Automate
@kai #recommend autoscaling policies for demand variations
```
