## Prompt Patterns

### Cost Analysis

```bash
# Spending overview
@alex analyze AWS spending trends over the last quarter

# Right-sizing
@alex identify EC2 instances with <20% CPU utilization over 30 days

# Reserved capacity
@alex compare reserved instances vs savings plans for our usage pattern

# Waste detection
@alex find unattached volumes, unused elastic IPs, and orphaned snapshots
```

### Performance Optimization

```bash
# Auto-scaling review
@alex review Auto Scaling groups and recommend threshold adjustments

# Network analysis
@alex analyze network traffic patterns and load balancer configuration

# Bottleneck detection
@alex identify resource bottlenecks in the web tier
```

### Multi-Cloud Operations

```bash
# Cost comparison
@alex compare AWS vs Azure costs for our current workloads

# Migration planning
@alex create migration plan from on-premise to AWS with cost analysis

# Unified analysis
@alex analyze spending across AWS, Azure, and GCP with consolidation recommendations
```

### Infrastructure Audit

```bash
# Comprehensive audit
@alex audit infrastructure for cost, performance, and security issues

# Governance check
@alex analyze resources against our cloud governance policies

# Architecture review
@alex review our microservices architecture for cost efficiency
```

## Tool Usage

| Tool | Alex Use Case |
|------|---------------|
| `#dashboard` | Cost trends, resource utilization, spending by service |
| `#report` | Quarterly cost analysis, migration assessments, architecture reviews |
| `#recommend` | Right-sizing, reserved capacity purchases, optimization actions |
| `#alert` | Budget thresholds, cost spikes, utilization anomalies |
| `#chart` | Spending trends, usage patterns, cost forecasts |

### Examples with Tools

```bash
@alex #dashboard monthly cost trends by service and region
@alex #report cost optimization opportunities with projected savings
@alex #recommend instances for right-sizing with implementation steps
@alex #alert when daily spend exceeds $5,000
```

## Common Workflows

### Monthly Cost Review

```bash
# Step 1: Overview
@alex #dashboard monthly cost summary by service

# Step 2: Identify issues
@alex which services had the largest cost increase?

# Step 3: Deep dive
@alex analyze RDS spending by instance type and utilization

# Step 4: Action
@alex #recommend cost optimizations with ROI timeline
```

### Infrastructure Optimization

```bash
# Step 1: Discovery
@alex audit all resources for optimization opportunities

# Step 2: Analysis
@alex #report detailed analysis of underutilized resources

# Step 3: Implementation
@alex #recommend right-sizing actions with rollback plan
```
