# Anna — General Manager

Anna is CloudThinker's coordination expert, specializing in multi-agent orchestration, complex project management, executive reporting, and strategic operations that span multiple domains.

---

## Capabilities

| Domain | Capabilities |
|--------|-------------|
| **Agent Coordination** | Orchestrating Alex, Oliver, Tony, Kai for complex operations |
| **Project Management** | Multi-phase projects, dependencies, timelines, risk management |
| **Executive Reporting** | Strategic summaries, KPI dashboards, board-level presentations |
| **Complex Operations** | Cloud migrations, security transformations, infrastructure overhauls |

---

## When to Use Anna

Use Anna when operations require:

- **Multiple agents** working on related aspects of a problem
- **Cross-domain expertise** (e.g., security + infrastructure + databases)
- **Executive-level visibility** or reporting
- **Project coordination** with dependencies and timelines

For single-domain tasks, use the specialized agent directly.
