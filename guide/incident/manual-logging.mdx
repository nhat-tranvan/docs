title: Manual Incident Logging

Not all incidents originate from monitoring platforms. When you observe issues directly, receive customer reports, or need to test the RCA workflow before configuring webhooks, manual incident creation provides immediate access to CloudThinker's AI-powered investigation capabilities. Manual logging ensures every issue—whether detected by automated alerts or human observation—receives structured tracking and systematic root cause analysis.

## Creating an Incident

</Frame>
<p style={{textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '0.9em', color: '#666', marginTop: '8px'}}>Manual incident creation form</p>

### Required Fields

**Title**
- Concise summary of the incident (e.g., "API Gateway 503 errors in production")
- Appears in incident list and notifications
- Used by AI agents to understand incident scope

**Description**
- Detailed context about what's happening
- Observable symptoms and customer impact
- Timeline of events if known
- Any initial troubleshooting steps already attempted

**Severity**
- `Critical`: Complete service outage, data loss, or security breach
- `High`: Major functionality degraded, significant customer impact
- `Medium`: Partial functionality affected, workarounds available
- `Low`: Minor issues, minimal customer impact

**Affected Services** (optional)
- Select from your topology map
- Helps RCA agents prioritize investigation scope
- Determines which specialized agents are activated
- Can be updated after investigation reveals additional impact

## What Happens Next

Once saved, CloudThinker automatically:

1. **Queues RCA Task**: AI investigation begins in background within seconds
2. **Activates Agents**: Specialized agents (Alex, Tony, Kai, Oliver) analyze your infrastructure based on affected services
3. **Builds Timeline**: Investigation findings logged in real-time with hypothesis tracking
4. **Identifies Root Cause**: Hypothesis-driven analysis with structured evidence chains
5. **Suggests Remediation**: Actionable steps prioritized by impact and urgency

Track progress in the [Root Cause Analysis](/guide/incident/root-cause-analysis) timeline, where you'll see agents gather context, test hypotheses, and build evidence chains.

## When to Use Manual vs Webhook Creation

| Scenario | Recommended Method |
|----------|-------------------|
| Monitoring platform alerts | [Webhook Integrations](/guide/incident/webhook-integrations) |
| Customer-reported issues | Manual Logging |
| Testing RCA workflow | Manual Logging |
| Ad-hoc investigations | Manual Logging |
| Proactive health checks | Manual Logging |
| Observed degradation (pre-alert) | Manual Logging |
