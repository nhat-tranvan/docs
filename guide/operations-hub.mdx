## Custom Operations

Create your own operations using CloudThinker Language:

```bash
# Combine agent + tool + context
@alex #recommend cost optimization for EC2 instances
  in us-east-1
  with <20% CPU utilization
  over past 30 days
  excluding production-critical

# Multi-agent operations
@anna coordinate security review:
  @oliver: audit security groups and IAM
  @alex: check for public resources
  @kai: review Kubernetes RBAC
```

See [CloudThinker Language](/guide/language) for complete syntax reference.

## Scheduling Operations

Set up recurring operations for continuous monitoring:

```bash
# Daily cost summary
@alex #schedule daily cost summary at 9am

# Weekly security audit
@oliver #schedule weekly security scan every Friday 5pm

# Monthly executive report
@anna #schedule monthly infrastructure report on 1st at 8am
```
