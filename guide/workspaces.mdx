# Workspaces

Create and manage your cloud operations workspaces. Workspaces are the foundation of your CloudThinker environment, providing isolated environments for different teams, projects, or cloud infrastructures.

## Overview

Workspaces in CloudThinker provide:

- **Isolated Environments**: Separate cloud operations for different teams or projects
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Choose your preferred cloud infrastructure provider
- **Team Collaboration**: Manage users and access within each workspace
- **Resource Organization**: Keep agents, connections, and knowledge bases organized
- **Flexible Management**: Create multiple workspaces for different use cases
