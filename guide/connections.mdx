    ### Managing Built-in Connections

    **Connecting a Service:**
    1. **Set up credentials**: Follow our [credential setup guide](/guide/credentials) to create read-only access
    2. Click the **Connect** button on the desired service
    3. Provide the required credentials and configuration
    4. Test the connection to ensure proper setup
    5. Save the connection for use in operations

    **Connection States:**
    - **Ready to connect**: Service is available but not yet configured
    - **Connected**: Service is active and ready for operations
    - **Disconnected**: Service was connected but is currently unavailable
